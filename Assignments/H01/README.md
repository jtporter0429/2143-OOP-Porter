# Homework 1
## Definitions
#### 1. Abstraction
#####    - The act of representing essential features without including background details or explanations.
#### 2. Attributes/Properties
#####    - A specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file.
#### 3. Class
#####    - A class is written by a programmer in a defined structure to create an object in an object-oriented programming language.
#### 4. Class Variable
#####    - A class variable is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist.
#### 5. Composition
#####    - Object composition is a way to combine objects or data types into more complex ones.
#### 6. Encapsulation
#####    - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.
#### 7. Friends
#####    - A friend function, that is a "friend" of a given class, is a function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data.
#### 8. Inheritance
#####    - In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different classes.
#### 9. Instance Variable
#####    - In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy.
#### 10. Member Variable
#####    - A member variable is a variable that is associated with a certain object, and accessible to all of its methods.
#### 11. Method
#####    - In object-oriented programming, a method is a procedure associated with a class.
#### 12. Multiple Inheritance
#####    - Multiple Inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent class or parent object
#### 13. Object
#####    - In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
#### 14. Overloading
#####    - Overloading allows the user to define two or more functions with the same name and in the same scope.
#### 15. Polymorphism
#####    - Polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
#### 16. Public/Private/Protected
#####    - Public: Any function can access.
#####    - Private: Only functions within the same class can access.
#####    - Protected: Members of subclasses are also allowed to access.
#### 17. Virtual
#####    - In general, it distinguishes something that is merely conceptual from something that has physical reality.
